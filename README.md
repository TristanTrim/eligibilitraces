# eligibilitraces

[live code here](https://tristantrim.github.io/eligibilitraces/)

This is a toy project for my study of machine learning. It is a visualization primarily of the sarsa lambda algorithm as described in Sutton's textbook. All mistakes and messiness are my own.

The code is written to run in browser and has no dependancies outside of a modern web browser, so if you fork this repo you will have your own copy already live on github pages.
